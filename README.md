# Meteor Garden Game
<body>A game in which you play as a wizard's daughter who is tested on her ability to defend the garden from
falling meteors</body>
<h3>About:</h3>
A wizard's daughter gets tested on her ability to defend the garden from meteors. 
You can move left, right and up. Contact with falling meteors will lead to 
 successful elimination of its threat to the garden. Allowing even one meteor to slip by
 is a failure to protect the garden. Occasionally a green flask 
will drop. Obtaining this flask allows the player to jump higher for one time. 
The game lasts for 60 seconds, after which the player wins the game
